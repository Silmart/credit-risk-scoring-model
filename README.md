# Credit Risk Prediction & Treasury Optimization 📊

### Business Problem
In corporate treasury and credit analysis, relying solely on manual validation of financial statements can be slow and prone to human error. The goal of this project is to automate the risk assessment process (Credit Scoring) using Machine Learning to predict the probability of client default.

### Solution Overview
Developed a **Random Forest Classification** model to analyze customer financial data and predict default risk.

* **Language:** Python 3
* **Libraries:** Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib
* **Technique:** Supervised Learning (Binary Classification)

### Key Insights (Simulation)
Based on the feature importance analysis generated by the model:
* **Credit Score** and **Total Debt** were identified as the primary drivers for default risk.
* The model achieved high accuracy in distinguishing "Good" vs "Bad" payers, which in a real-world scenario translates to a reduction in **Bad Debt Provision (PDD)**.

### How to Run
1.  Open the `Analise_Risco_Credito_Portfolio.ipynb` file.
2.  Run the cells to visualize the decision tree logic and the feature importance chart.
